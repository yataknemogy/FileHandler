# Exception Handling in File Reading and Writing

The program has two functions:
1. Reading text from a file
2. Writing text to a file

When reading text from a file, the program should handle the following exceptions:

- If the file does not exist, display an error message and prompt the user to enter the name of an existing file.
- If the file cannot be read (e.g., due to lack of permissions), display an error message.

When writing text to a file, the program should also handle exceptions:

- If the file cannot be created or overwritten, display an error message.
- If an error occurs during writing, such as insufficient disk space, handle this error.

Implement a menu that allows the user to choose whether to read text from a file, write text to a file, or exit the program.
